      <h1>A Note about Calgary </h1>
       <p>Calgary has numbered Streets and Avenues starting 
                            from the centre of the city. Streets run north-south 
                            and Avenues run East-west. It is important to know 
                            if you are looking for a STREET or and AVENUE. The 
                            city is divided into quadrants: NORTHWEST (NW), SOUTHWEST 
                            (SW), NORTHEAST (NE) and SOUTHEAST (SE). Once again 
                            the quadrant is essential to get somewhere. Hwy #1 
                            is 16th Avenue north and runs east and west. Many 
                            of the major arteries are called Trails or Boulevards 
                            (Blvd). </p>
